<h2>Food Sprout Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<br>
<strong>Q: Where do you get the data?</strong>
<p>We collect the data from a variety of sources from the business owners to our own investigation team.  Our goal is to leave no stone unturned.

<strong>Q: How do you verify the data?</strong>
	<p>We currently partner with a few non-profits that also have the same goals and alliance as we do.  Without the help of these organizations we would not be able to bring this data to you on this platform.  Right now most non-profits are aimed at certifying farms while we focus on finding where those farms send their food.  Because we are an open platform on the web, this lends itself to transparency as well. Users can update data and challenge others claims.

<strong>Q: How do you decide who is sustainable?</strong>
<p>We are continuely improving this scale.  As we gain more data the accuracy of the sustainability claims will become more clear.  In making things transparent we are opening the issue up for debate as well.  We look at things like: sourcing ingredients locally, farms that cultivate soil to restaurants that avoid fish on the Seafood Watch guide.

<strong>Q: Why are big chains like McDonald's included?</strong>
<p>While we think it is important to shine a spot light on the local businesses in your area that are doing well we also think it is equally as important to show how the bigger chains are doing poorly.  We want to make the food supply web transparent.  This would include showing the impact these giant companies have on the environment and food system.
