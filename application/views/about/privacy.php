There are places on our website where you may click on a link to access 
other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, 
if you click on an advertisement or a search result on our website, 
you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party 
websites may independently solicit and collect information, including 
personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with 
information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that

<p><a name="0.2_security"></a><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial"><b>How 
we protect your personal information</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial">We take appropriate security 
measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to 
help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and 
disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to 
access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business 
functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your 
sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we 
use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access 
to your personal information.  <br>
 <br>
We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. 
However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we 
take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should 
not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications 
will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they 
handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending 
personal information through insecure e-mail. Please refer to the Federal 
Trade Commission's website for information about how to protect yourself 
against identity theft.  <br>
 <br>
<a name="0.2_reviews"></a><b>Reviews</b> <br>

We may provide areas on our websites where you can post information 
about yourself and others and communicate with others, and the like, 
or upload content (e.g., pictures, videos, audio files, etc.). Such 
postings are governed by our Terms of Service. In addition, such postings 
may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject 
of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information 
on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available 
and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you share your 
e-mail address or other information with others, you may receive unsolicited 
messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users 
may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you 
to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. 
Once you have posted information, you will not be able to edit or delete 
such information.  <br>
