HOWTO: Update db

This quick tutorial/steps will help you update the database to the latest version.

Step 1:

Reverse engineer the current database into a MySQL Workbench file

Step 2:

Rename the newly imported schema to "food2" (there is a bug in Workbench where the current Workbench file we use has food2 deep somewhere in the script)

Step 3:

Go to File > Export > Forward Engineer SQL Create script...

Step 4:

Open the latest Workbench file from SVN that contains the latest db schema

Step 5:

Go to File > Export > Forward Engineer SQL Alter script...

Step 6:

Find the create script that was created in step 3 and select that as the first option, leave the second option blank to generate the alter script in MySQL workbench
